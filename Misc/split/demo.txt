They stand in shadows, dust, and grit,  
With silent courage, never quit.  
The weight of sky, the earth below,  
In every step, their strength does show.  

No banners wave, no crowds applaud,  
Just boots that press the soil, flawed.  
In fields where silence lingers long,  
They walk the lines, unbroken, strong.  

Each heartbeat echoes something moreâ€”  
A steady pulse, a quiet roar.  
For those who serve and those who wait,  
Their story writes on hands of fate.  

No need for fame, no thirst for praise,  
They walk through nights, they face the days.  
For what is right, for what is owed,  
They bear the weight of every load.
